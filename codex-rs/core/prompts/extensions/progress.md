# Progress Updates Extension

For longer tasks (many tool calls, multi-step plans):
- Provide updates at reasonable intervals
- 1-2 sentences, 8-10 words
- Recap progress, state next step

Before large chunks of work:
- Inform user what you're doing and why
- Don't start editing large files without notice
