## CONTEXT CONTINUATION - DO NOT RESTART

**IMPORTANT**: Another LLM was working on this task and made progress. The summary below describes the current state.

**Your job is to CONTINUE from where they left off, NOT to restart.**

Before taking any action:
1. Read the summary carefully to understand what was already done
2. If files were being created/edited, verify their current state first (use `ls -la` or `cat`)
3. Identify the NEXT step, not the first step
4. If the summary mentions sandbox/permission issues, use alternative approaches

**If the summary mentions a file was being created:**
- First CHECK if the file exists and what its current size is
- Do NOT recreate the file if it already has content
- APPEND or EDIT only what's needed

Here is the handoff summary from the previous session:
